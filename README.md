# Flight Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction Project! In this data science endeavor, our mission is to predict flight prices accurately. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to provide travelers with reliable price estimates for their upcoming flights, empowering them to make informed decisions.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight prices based on various factors such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airlines, flight times, and additional contextual data. By analyzing historical flight data, we strive to build a robust prediction model that helps travelers anticipate ticket costs effectively.

## Project Tasks

1. **Data Collection:** Gather comprehensive flight data, including departure and arrival locations, dates, airlines, flight times, historical pricing, and seasonal patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanse and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and feature encoding. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features, create new variables, and leverage domain knowledge to enhance data representation for accurate price predictions. Handle categorical variables through techniques like one-hot encoding and feature scaling.
4. **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and fine-tune machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, to create a reliable prediction model. Utilize techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorously assess models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared to ensure accurate flight price estimations. Conduct feature importance analysis to understand the impact of different variables on predictions.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** Utilize Python programming language for data analysis, preprocessing, and model implementation.
- **Libraries:** Leverage Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization, and Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Apply ensemble methods, feature selection techniques, and advanced regression algorithms to improve model accuracy.
  
## Evaluation Criteria

The accuracy of flight price predictions will be evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared, ensuring the models provide reliable estimates for travelers. Focus on achieving the lowest possible error metrics for accurate predictions.
